Investigation into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

The .xlsx file is a Google Sheet that can also be opened in Excel, detailing CNNs step by step on sheets.

The three '.pdf' files, all created by me, are a tutorial providing theoretical insights and explanations about CNNs for educational purposes, the slides of presentation and a '.pdf' version for the CNN sheet."
